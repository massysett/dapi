dapi - prints a series of dates to standard output.

The name is short for "date picker".

dapi's web pages:

http://github.com/massysett/dapi - has a little more information, and
a link to the manual page.

http://hackage.haskell.org/package/dapi
http://github.com/massysett/dapi

To install dapi, just run "cabal install dapi". This will not install
the manual page, so copy it yourself to a good location (maybe "sudo
cp dapi.1 /usr/share/man/man1" or "sudo install -Dm644 dapi.1
/usr/local/share/man/man1". If you do not want to install the man
page, you can read it where it is by including a slash when you invoke
man (for instance, "man ./dapi.1".
